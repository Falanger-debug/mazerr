### Features
- **Interactive Control Panel**: Start, pause, continue generating
- **Maze Customization**: Adjust maze size, tempo and method of generating it
- **Real-time Simulation**: Generate maze and please your eyes
### Generating Methods
- **Recursive Backtracking**:
  This algorithm randomly visits neighboring cells, marking them as part of the maze path. If it encounters a cell with no unvisited neighbors, it "backtracks" to the last visited cell with unvisited neighbors and continues. This creates a maze with a single path from start to finish, without cycles.

- **Prim's Algorithm**:
  Prim's algorithm builds a maze by starting from an initial cell and adding random walls to a frontier list. For each step, it picks a random wall from the frontier, connects it to an unvisited cell, and adds new walls to the frontier. This method results in a maze with multiple paths and a more "natural" look.

- **Kruskal's Algorithm**:
  Kruskalâ€™s algorithm generates a maze by treating each cell as a distinct set and gradually merging them. It randomly removes walls between cells, merging sets as it connects them. This continues until all cells are interconnected in a single set, creating a maze with complex paths and potential cycles.

### Installation
Ensure you have Java21 or higher installed, along with Maven. Then follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Falanger-debug/mazerr.git
   cd mazerr
   ```
2. **Build the project:** Maven automates dependencies and builds the project. To do so, run:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. **Run the application:** Once the project is built, start the Spring application using Maven:
   ```
   msv spring-boot:run
   ```
4. **Access the application:** After starting, you can access the Mazerr interface in your web browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
